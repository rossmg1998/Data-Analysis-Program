# Overview

This is a program where I do some basic analyzing of a dataset of my choosing, using the object-oriented 
programming language Python and the Python package Pandas.

I am analyzing a dataset of 200 mall customers. The information in the dataset includes the gender, age, annual income, and spending score of each of customer.

My purpose for writing this software is to gain some experience with analyzing data, by identifying some questions I can use as a guide with my chosen dataset.
